## Course Description

Applications rarely are comprised of a tangled set of static files. They're dynamic. They update. They remember things. The course will introduce the concepts of a database and Web applications as a set of design problems. The class will investigate server-side applications, third-party data sources and APIs and how applications can become dynamic and highly functional. To approach the design and construction of applications that derive from datasources and databases, this course builds upon an essential knowledge of Web Standards, user interface design, and usability to support the creation of functional and responsive projects for the Web across multiple devices and platforms. Students will incorporate interaction design, visual design, user experience and code to rapidly sculpt data into content. By the end of the course, students should be able to design, build and deploy data-driven Web applications. The course employs a pedagogy suitable for designers, artists and technologists who seek an empowerment achieved by being able to build data-driven applications. We will learn JavaScript properly. Then, we will learn useful design patterns. Then we will pick up useful tools for making cool things better.
